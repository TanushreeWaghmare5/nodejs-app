# Node.js App with Kubernetes Deployment

This project is a responsive, attractive Node.js application built using Express and EJS, and it is containerized with Docker. The application is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster using manifest files located in the `k8s/` directory.

## Overview

This Node.js application serves a dynamic web page using Express and EJS templates. The UI is built with Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and modern design. The project also contains Kubernetes manifests that deploy the app as a Deployment with multiple replicas and expose it via a NodePort service.

```

## Local Development

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher recommended)
   - [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   Start the app with:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```
   The application will start on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Dockerization

1. **Build the Docker Image:**

   Ensure you have Docker installed. From the project root, run:
   ```bash
   docker build -t yourusername/node-app:latest .
   ```
   Replace `yourusername` with your Docker Hub username.

2. **Run the Docker Container Locally:**

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 yourusername/node-app:latest
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

3. **Push the Image to a Registry:**

   Log in to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```
   Then push the image:
   ```bash
   docker push yourusername/node-app:latest
   ```

## Kubernetes Deployment

The `k8s/` directory contains the manifests for deploying the application on a Kubernetes cluster.

### Deployment Manifest (`k8s/deployment.yaml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: node-app-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: node-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: node-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: node-app
        image: yourusername/node-app:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 3000
```

### Service Manifest (`k8s/service.yaml`)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: node-app-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: node-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80         # Service port
      targetPort: 3000 # Container port
      nodePort: 30080  # NodePort (30000-32767 range)
```

### Deploying to Kubernetes

1. **Apply the Manifests:**

   Make sure your Kubernetes cluster is running (e.g., via Minikube). Then, from the `k8s/` directory, run:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```

2. **Access the Application:**

   If using Minikube, you can use:
   ```bash
   minikube service node-app-service
   ```
   Alternatively, access it via the Minikube IP:
   ```
   http://<minikube-ip>:30080
   ```

3. **Port Forwarding (if needed):**

   To troubleshoot or access the app locally, you can run:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward service/node-app-service 30080:80
   ```
   Then open [http://localhost:30080](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
